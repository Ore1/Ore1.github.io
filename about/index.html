      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Modupeoreoluwa, which means I thank God for God's gift. The short form and what everyone calls me is
        "Ore", meaning gift. I was born in Nigeria, West Africa and lived there all my life until I moved to the United States three
        years ago. I'm the eldest with a younger sister and brother. I graduated high school here in Chicago in 2015 and started 
        college at Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago. I'm in my second year; currently majoring in Information Technology and 
        Management. I do not have a specialization yet, but I'm thinking of going into cyber security. I'm also thinking of pursuing 
        Masters coupled with my Bachelors in my current major. I see myself as a goal-oriented, curious, and easy-going person.

      <h2>Interesting facts about me</h2>
      <p>
        I enjoy cooking, travelling, watching TV shows, exploring new things/places, and working with computers.
        I have visited 7 states in the U.S (Virginia, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Ohio, Michigan, and Purdue) and 
        wish to visit more places! I attended a leadership retreat where I developed some leadership skills. During the retreat,
        I worked with about 5 teammates to build a boat that would sail on water out of a cardboard...yes cardboard and did 
        low ropes and canoeing.

      <h2>Aspiration</h2>
      <p>
        I hope to manage my own company and use my degrees (Bachelors and Masters) to positively impact the community
        by providing the platform for young and curious youths to learn more about technology.
